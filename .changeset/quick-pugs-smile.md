feat: show transcoding progress on the video button

The button sat on "Конвертируется…" for the whole encode, which on a long clip is indistinguishable from a hang. Depot already had the percentage in its logs, so it now travels on `spotter.media.progress` and the button reads "Конвертируется… 40%". Updates are rounded down to tens and only sent when the number moves, keeping it to at most ten edits per clip; a broken publish is swallowed, since progress must never fail a transcode.
