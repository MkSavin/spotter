fix: survive a restart of any other service at any time

Watchtower can restart anything at any moment, so every service has to tolerate every other one disappearing under it. Several could not, and the failures shared one shape: the process stayed alive and the container stayed "running" while the service did nothing at all — so the restart policy never fired and the problem was only visible to users.

**A Redis client that outlives its connection timeout is finished.** Measured against a real server: an outage under ~10s is absorbed by the offline queue and never surfaces, but a longer one puts the client in a state it never leaves — Redis came back and every command still failed, indefinitely. `maxRetries` does not change this; the two configurations were compared directly and neither recovers. Only a new client does, which is why recreating the container was the one thing that ever worked. `RedisConnection` now owns the client and rebuilds it on a dead connection, recovering in about a second, and all sixteen call sites use it.

**A consumer group that disappears never comes back.** A Redis restored without its data answers every `XREADGROUP` with `NOGROUP`, and the read loop retried that forever, once a second, with no possible outcome. The loop now recognises it and recreates the groups.

**A wedged service was indistinguishable from a working one.** No `spotter-*` container had a healthcheck. Each now refreshes a marker file only while Redis actually answers it, so a service that stops working goes stale and gets restarted; a brief blip stays well inside the threshold.

**A clip request did not survive the bot.** The wait lived in memory, so a restart left the "⏳" button frozen with no way to retry even after the video arrived. Waits are persisted and released on startup as a retry.

Depot also sweeps temp directories left by a killed predecessor — each run creates a fresh one, so the orphans accumulated — and gets a 45s stop grace period, since ffmpeg cannot finish inside Docker's default 10s.
