feat: build timelapses over a chosen period

`/timelapse` asks for a camera and a speed with buttons and takes the period as text — `сегодня`, `вчера`, `15.08`, or `15.08 09:00-18:00`. The period is read in the bot's own timezone; parsing it as UTC would have shifted every export by the offset, silently returning the wrong hours.

**Two speeds, not a number.** Frigate's export API accepts exactly `realtime` and `timelapse_25x` — verified against the v0.17.0 source, and the open request for a per-export factor is still unimplemented. What the second one compresses to is set by `record.export.timelapse_args` in the NVR's config and applies globally, so the button says "ускоренно" rather than promising a multiplier this side cannot know.

**An export is not a download.** It re-encodes hours of recordings and runs for minutes, well past the regulator's five-minute reclaim window. Waiting for it inside the request handler would leave the entry pending until the reaper handed it to another consumer, which would start the same export a second time. So the adapter acknowledges as soon as the NVR accepts the job, and a tracker polls it to completion, stages the result into S3 and publishes `spotter.timelapse.ready` — or `.failed` with a reason the user can act on, rather than a message that never updates.

Started exports are recorded on a volume and resumed on startup: a restart mid-encode would otherwise leave the NVR producing a file nobody is waiting for. The forwarder carries the new streams both ways, since on a split deployment the bot and the adapter sit on different nodes. The finished file is fetched from Frigate's nginx — the export record's `video_path` points inside the container — and deleted from the NVR once it is safely in S3.
