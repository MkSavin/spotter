feat: make the PWA a real client, not a read-only feed

The PWA could show events and nothing else. It published nothing to the bus, so every action the bot offers — a camera snapshot, a clip, the camera list, service status — simply did not exist there. What blocked all of them was the same missing piece: a way to send a command and hear back.

`CommandBus` was telegram-local despite depending on nothing telegram-specific, so it moves to `@spotter/transport` alongside `HeartbeatRegistry` and a role vocabulary that was already copied into two services and about to be copied into a third.

**Access is granted once, not once per frontend.** A device now redeems a code through the domain (`device.redeem`) from the same pool `/user_sign` mints for the bot, and gets back the real role the server enforces on every later command. Previously the PWA checked codes against a local `PWA_ACCESS_CODES` list that carried no role at all — which is why nothing beyond reading could have worked even with a channel. A code minted for a named Telegram user is refused: there is no username on a device to match it against, and honouring it would hand a personal code to whoever typed it first.

An authorized install lives in its own `devices` table rather than hanging off a push subscription: being authorized is a redeemed code, not permission to send notifications, and browsers rotate a push endpoint without the user doing anything. A role change or revocation reaches the device over `spotter.delivery.recipient`, so a demoted user stops being offered buttons that would only fail.

The feed is now behind the same token. It carries snapshots of the house, and serving it to anyone who knows the URL was never intended.
