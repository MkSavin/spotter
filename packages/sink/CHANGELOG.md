### Patch Changes

- ec9422d: Answer media requests even when the NVR has nothing to give.
  
  `createMediaController` returned silently when staging produced no keys — the
  NVR 404s an event it no longer has, or never had. Nothing was published, so the
  bot's "Видео обрабатывается…" button stayed that way forever, with no timeout to
  clear it. It now publishes a `MediaProcessed` with no keys, and the bot restores
  the "Видео" button instead of leaving the message stuck.
  
  The empty answer is what `test_delivery` exposed — its synthetic ids exist in no
  NVR — but the same path is hit by real events whose recordings have aged out.
- 084d12a: Replace `/deployment_version` with `/status`, reporting every service instead of
  just the bot.
  
  The old command read the bot's own `package.json`, so it could only ever show
  one version. Services now announce themselves on `spotter.heartbeat` — name,
  version, node and uptime — on start and every 30 seconds; the bot keeps the
  latest report per service and renders them grouped by node.
  
  Carried on a stream rather than a Redis key, because keys do not cross the
  forwarder: a key-based report would leave the cloud bot blind to everything
  running on the ingest node.
  
  A service that dies stops reporting rather than announcing it, so reports older
  than three intervals are shown as offline instead of vanishing — an outage stays
  visible in the output.
  
  Services also report what they run on: the frigate adapter probes the NVR build
  via `/api/version`, depot reports its ffmpeg and the active acceleration, and
  server and telegram report the Redis server version. Probes resolve once and
  swallow their own failures — a broken probe must not cost the heartbeat.
