### Minor Changes

- a53eb49: feat: build timelapses over a chosen period
  
  `/timelapse` asks for a camera and a speed with buttons and takes the period as text — `сегодня`, `вчера`, `15.08`, or `15.08 09:00-18:00`. The period is read in the bot's own timezone; parsing it as UTC would have shifted every export by the offset, silently returning the wrong hours.
  
  **Two speeds, not a number.** Frigate's export API accepts exactly `realtime` and `timelapse_25x` — verified against the v0.17.0 source, and the open request for a per-export factor is still unimplemented. What the second one compresses to is set by `record.export.timelapse_args` in the NVR's config and applies globally, so the button says "ускоренно" rather than promising a multiplier this side cannot know.
  
  **An export is not a download.** It re-encodes hours of recordings and runs for minutes, well past the regulator's five-minute reclaim window. Waiting for it inside the request handler would leave the entry pending until the reaper handed it to another consumer, which would start the same export a second time. So the adapter acknowledges as soon as the NVR accepts the job, and a tracker polls it to completion, stages the result into S3 and publishes `spotter.timelapse.ready` — or `.failed` with a reason the user can act on, rather than a message that never updates.
  
  Started exports are recorded on a volume and resumed on startup: a restart mid-encode would otherwise leave the NVR producing a file nobody is waiting for. The forwarder carries the new streams both ways, since on a split deployment the bot and the adapter sit on different nodes. The finished file is fetched from Frigate's nginx — the export record's `video_path` points inside the container — and deleted from the NVR once it is safely in S3.

### Patch Changes

- a53eb49: fix: survive a restart of any other service at any time
  
  Watchtower can restart anything at any moment, so every service has to tolerate every other one disappearing under it. Several could not, and the failures shared one shape: the process stayed alive and the container stayed "running" while the service did nothing at all — so the restart policy never fired and the problem was only visible to users.
  
  **A Redis client that outlives its connection timeout is finished.** Measured against a real server: an outage under ~10s is absorbed by the offline queue and never surfaces, but a longer one puts the client in a state it never leaves — Redis came back and every command still failed, indefinitely. `maxRetries` does not change this; the two configurations were compared directly and neither recovers. Only a new client does, which is why recreating the container was the one thing that ever worked. `RedisConnection` now owns the client and rebuilds it on a dead connection, recovering in about a second, and all sixteen call sites use it.
  
  **A consumer group that disappears never comes back.** A Redis restored without its data answers every `XREADGROUP` with `NOGROUP`, and the read loop retried that forever, once a second, with no possible outcome. The loop now recognises it and recreates the groups.
  
  **A wedged service was indistinguishable from a working one.** No `spotter-*` container had a healthcheck. Each now refreshes a marker file only while Redis actually answers it, so a service that stops working goes stale and gets restarted; a brief blip stays well inside the threshold.
  
  **A clip request did not survive the bot.** The wait lived in memory, so a restart left the "⏳" button frozen with no way to retry even after the video arrived. Waits are persisted and released on startup as a retry.
  
  Depot also sweeps temp directories left by a killed predecessor — each run creates a fresh one, so the orphans accumulated — and gets a 45s stop grace period, since ffmpeg cannot finish inside Docker's default 10s.
- a53eb49: fix: recover the NVR catalog without restarting the adapter
  
  Restarting a cloud service left it showing "неизв. камера" indefinitely, and nothing brought the names back — the only cure found in practice was recreating `spotter-frigate`.
  
  Three things had to line up for that. The `spotter.catalog.<source>` key belongs to the ingest node's Redis and deliberately does not cross the forwarder, so a cloud consumer's `bootstrap` never finds it. Its consumer group is created at `$`, so it only ever sees snapshots published after it started. And the catalog was published exactly once per adapter process — the refresh added earlier only republishes on change, and a camera list that never changes never triggers one, which closed the last route back.
  
  Consumers now ask: `spotter.catalog.request` is answered by the owning adapter with a republish, the forwarder carries it down to the ingest node, and `bootstrap` falls back through the local key, a copy persisted in SQLite, and finally the request. The adapter also force-publishes every few quiet refreshes, so a consumer that missed both still converges within the hour.

## 1.5.6

### Patch Changes

- e9837f1: fix: do not let an example's `# hint` become a config value
  
  The `.env` examples annotate their settings inline (`VIDEO_CODEC=hevc # h264 | hevc`). Both Bun's `--env-file` and compose's `env_file` strip that before the process sees it, so this was never breaking a normal deployment — but a value injected any other way (compose `environment:`, a shell export, CI) is passed through verbatim, and the hint silently becomes the value, failing enum validation and falling back to a default without a word.
  
  `env.enum`, `env.number`, `env.boolean` and `env.stringArray` now drop a trailing hint themselves. `env.string` deliberately does not: it carries secrets and URLs, where a hash is a legitimate character and truncating one would be worse than the problem being guarded against. Only a hash preceded by whitespace counts, so a URL fragment survives either way.
  
  The examples no longer carry inline hints at all — the option lists moved to the line above, where no parser has to be trusted — and `install.ts` strips any that remain when it generates a real `.env`.

## 1.5.5

### Patch Changes

- edbd2d6: fix: notice cameras added in the NVR without restarting the adapter
  
  The catalog was published exactly once per process lifetime. `keepCatalogPublished` retried only until the first snapshot landed and then stopped, and `FrigateCatalog` memoized the `/api/config` response forever, so a camera added in Frigate stayed invisible to the bot until `spotter-frigate` was restarted. The schema comment promised "on start and on change", but nothing implemented the second half.
  
  The loop now keeps going after the first success on a slow interval, and `publishCatalog` compares the serialized snapshot against the last one it sent — an unchanged catalog is not republished, so the refresh does not wake every consumer on a timer. The `/api/config` memo gained a TTL, without which the loop would keep re-reading the same cached answer.
  
  `camera_snapshot` also skipped validation entirely when the catalog was empty: the `cameras.length > 0` guard sat in front of the comparison, so any typed name went straight to the NVR.

## 1.5.4

### Patch Changes

- 56c21b1: fix: survive a Redis restart instead of dying on it
  
  A durable Redis replaying its AOF answers every command with `-LOADING` until it finishes. `XGROUP CREATE` treated that as fatal, so `run()` rejected and the process exited — the forwarder died on exactly the restart its store-and-forward buffer exists to survive, and needed a manual recreate to come back.
  
  Group creation now waits `-LOADING` out (up to two minutes) while any other error still fails fast. The Redis healthchecks were complicit and are fixed too: `redis-cli` exits 0 even on an error reply, so a bare `ping` reported healthy mid-load; they now grep for `PONG`.

## 1.5.3

### Patch Changes

- 313ab95: feat: keep snapshots moving while clips transcode
  
  Every depot replica read one `spotter.media.staged` stream, so a couple of long video transcodes occupied every worker and the snapshots queued behind them — and the snapshot is what makes a notification informative in the first place.
  
  Clips now travel on their own `spotter.media.staged.clip` stream, and `DEPOT_LANE` (`all` | `snapshots` | `clips`) picks what a replica consumes. The split has to happen at the stream level rather than by filtering after the read: a consumer never receives a stream it did not register, so a snapshot-only replica cannot pull a clip out of the shared group and drop it. Camera frames ride the snapshot lane, being equally quick and user-facing. The ingest profile now runs two clip workers plus one snapshot worker; single-node keeps the default `all` and is unchanged.
  
  The clip button also read "Конвертируется…" while the job was still waiting for a free worker. Without a percentage nothing is converting yet, so that state now reads "В очереди…" — ffmpeg reports progress the moment it actually starts.

## 1.5.2

### Patch Changes

- f6ff724: refactor: share CatalogCache and catalogController from transport
  
  The catalog controller was byte-identical in telegram, pwa and email, and four near-identical `CatalogCache` copies had already started drifting apart in comments and helpers. Both now live in `@spotter/transport`, where the rest of the catalog contract already sits, so a change to label resolution is one edit instead of four.
- f6ff724: fix: retry transient media failures instead of acking them away
  
  A failed transcode was indistinguishable from a broken clip: `mediaStagedAction` caught every error, returned empty, and the controller published `media_processed` — so the regulator acked. An S3 blip or a not-yet-visible staged object therefore lost the media for good, bypassing the PEL/reaper/DLQ machinery entirely. S3 reads/writes and ffmpeg timeouts now raise `TransientError` and propagate, leaving the entry pending for the reaper; only genuinely broken media (bad codec, unreadable input) still reports a final miss. Clip and snapshot are judged independently, so a permanent failure of one does not hold back the other.
  
  The dead-letter boundary was also off by one: `deliveries > maxDeliveries` granted a sixth attempt against a documented budget of five, which for a transcode is a wasted full run.

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 9552750: feat: show transcoding progress on the video button
  
  The button sat on "Конвертируется…" for the whole encode, which on a long clip is indistinguishable from a hang. Depot already had the percentage in its logs, so it now travels on `spotter.media.progress` and the button reads "Конвертируется… 40%". Updates are rounded down to tens and only sent when the number moves, keeping it to at most ten edits per clip; a broken publish is swallowed, since progress must never fail a transcode.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 9569cee: feat: real progress for a requested clip
  
  The "Видео" button now moves through its actual stages (запрошено → скачивается → конвертируется) instead of showing one frozen label until the video lands. A clip that fails or takes too long ends with a retry button and the reason, so a stuck request is something the user can act on rather than a spinner that never stops.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 084d12a: Replace `/deployment_version` with `/status`, reporting every service instead of
  just the bot.
  
  The old command read the bot's own `package.json`, so it could only ever show
  one version. Services now announce themselves on `spotter.heartbeat` — name,
  version, node and uptime — on start and every 30 seconds; the bot keeps the
  latest report per service and renders them grouped by node.
  
  Carried on a stream rather than a Redis key, because keys do not cross the
  forwarder: a key-based report would leave the cloud bot blind to everything
  running on the ingest node.
  
  A service that dies stops reporting rather than announcing it, so reports older
  than three intervals are shown as offline instead of vanishing — an outage stays
  visible in the output.
  
  Services also report what they run on: the frigate adapter probes the NVR build
  via `/api/version`, depot reports its ffmpeg and the active acceleration, and
  server and telegram report the Redis server version. Probes resolve once and
  swallow their own failures — a broken probe must not cost the heartbeat.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 52344b5: New PWA frontend (`apps/pwa`): the primary delivery frontend — an installable
  Progressive Web App plus a thin single-process Bun server. It consumes
  `spotter.delivery.event` and sends **Web Push** (VAPID, via `web-push`) to
  subscribed devices, and serves the web app itself (Vite + React 19 + shadcn/ui +
  Tailwind v4). One codebase pushes to iPhone / Android / desktop — no App Store,
  no Apple account.

  Server: `Bun.serve` (static + SPA fallback + REST API + `RedisRegulator`),
  `PushGateway` (VAPID configured at boot, 404/410 subscriptions pruned on
  fan-out), and a per-camera `PushCoalescer` that collapses event storms into one
  "N событий" push. Dedup (level 1): push only on `create`, atomic
  `notified_events` claim (same pattern as `apps/email`, released on failure so
  the regulator retries), server-side `topic` + client-side `tag` for
  double-guarded notification coalescing. SQLite/drizzle holds push subscriptions,
  the dedup ledger and a rolling `recent_events` feed cache.

  UI: dark-first, three screens — Feed (day-grouped list with skeletons, empty /
  error / realtime states), Event (media hero, metadata, fullscreen snapshot
  dialog) and Setup (progressive-disclosure onboarding: install → notification
  permission → one-time code, plus device management). Own lightweight
  History-API router and theme hook (no extra deps). Custom service worker
  (`injectManifest`, online-only, no precache): `push` → notification, click →
  deep-link, and posts to open tabs so the feed refreshes live. VAPID public key
  is delivered at runtime via `GET /api/vapid`, so one build works for any
  deployer. Device authorization is a local one-time-code check in v1
  (`PWA_ACCESS_CODES`).

  `@spotter/transport` gains a shared, channel-agnostic event renderer
  (`renderEvent` / `renderEventTiming` / `renderEventTime`) now used by both `pwa`
  and `email` (email dropped its private copy; the >24h duration formatting bug is
  fixed in the shared version), and `redactConfig` now masks `private`-named keys
  (e.g. the VAPID private key). Ships `.env.pwa.example`, an optional (commented)
  service in `production.cloud.yml` (requires HTTPS), and per-app `AGENTS.md`.
