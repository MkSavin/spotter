## 1.5.5

### Patch Changes

- f6ff724: refactor: share CatalogCache and catalogController from transport
  
  The catalog controller was byte-identical in telegram, pwa and email, and four near-identical `CatalogCache` copies had already started drifting apart in comments and helpers. Both now live in `@spotter/transport`, where the rest of the catalog contract already sits, so a change to label resolution is one edit instead of four.
- f6ff724: refactor: read config through resolveConfig and cover the untested paths
  
  `transcode.ts` read eleven env vars at module scope, so the values froze at import time, skipped the redacted startup dump and could not be swapped in tests — which is why the largest file in the repo had the thinnest coverage. They now belong to `config.video`/`config.image` and arrive as an argument.
  
  Test coverage follows the same reasoning: `CommandBus` (RPC correlation, timeout, replies addressed to another replica, junk on the stream) had none despite driving the whole "Видео" button flow, so its timeouts became injectable and it is now covered. The frigate test-seed controller's id/timestamp derivation moved into a pure `resolveEventTestPayload`, and the dead-letter boundary gained a test that pins the exact threshold.

## 1.5.4

### Patch Changes

- 9552750: feat: show transcoding progress on the video button
  
  The button sat on "Конвертируется…" for the whole encode, which on a long clip is indistinguishable from a hang. Depot already had the percentage in its logs, so it now travels on `spotter.media.progress` and the button reads "Конвертируется… 40%". Updates are rounded down to tens and only sent when the number moves, keeping it to at most ten edits per clip; a broken publish is swallowed, since progress must never fail a transcode.

## 1.5.3

### Patch Changes

- dbb2afa: fix: install only the dependencies each image actually uses
  
  Every Dockerfile ran an unfiltered `bun install`, so each backend image downloaded the PWA's frontend toolchain — vite, tailwind and lightningcss's native prebuilds. The arm64 leg then failed extracting `lightningcss-linux-arm64-musl`, a package none of those apps import. The install stage now takes the package name as a build argument and passes it to `--filter`, which drops the telegram image from the full dependency tree to 81 packages and leaves the workspace symlinks intact.

## 1.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 97bc8e0: fix: `/camera_snapshot` without a name, and quieter heartbeat logs
  
  An empty argument reached the lookup and produced "Камера  не найдена" with a blank name; it now asks for a camera and lists the available ones — as does the not-found reply. Heartbeats are no longer logged every 30 seconds per service: only a service appearing or changing version is worth a line.

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 1d88f83: fix: requesting a clip that is not ready duplicated the message
  
  When the NVR had no clip yet, the empty result took the create/update path, whose `editMessageText` cannot edit a message that already carries a photo. The failure threw, the entry was redelivered, and the user saw a second copy of the event without its snapshot while the button hung on "processing". An empty result now only repaints the button, and says the clip may simply not be written yet — a retry a little later usually works. A media artifact the NVR refuses is logged at warn instead of debug, so the reason is visible.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 9569cee: feat: real progress for a requested clip
  
  The "Видео" button now moves through its actual stages (запрошено → скачивается → конвертируется) instead of showing one frozen label until the video lands. A clip that fails or takes too long ends with a retry button and the reason, so a stuck request is something the user can act on rather than a spinner that never stops.

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- b1fff5c: fix: ingest node visible in /status
  
  Heartbeats now cross the forwarder, and the forwarder reports itself, so
  `/status` lists the ingest services instead of the cloud alone. The unknown
  command handler no longer answers commands that exist.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e0b21d8: feat: rollout notices for admins
  
  Telegram tracks the version of every service in SQLite and sends admins a silent
  notice once a rollout settles. Versions persist, so a restart of the bot itself
  reports nothing, and a service updated while the bot was down is still caught.

### Patch Changes

- 74369d7: fix: unknown command message and cli refactor

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ae4d268: Add `/test_media` — an end-to-end test that exercises the real media pipeline.
  
  `/test_delivery` seeds a synthetic event, so the NVR 404s every media request for
  it: useful for checking delivery, useless for checking media. `/test_media` asks
  Frigate to create an actual event via `POST /api/events/{camera}/{label}/create`,
  waits for the footage, ends it, and publishes the canonical event with the id
  Frigate assigned. The clip genuinely exists, so staging, transcoding, presigning
  and delivery all run for real.
  
  Frigate does not announce manual events on `frigate/events`, which is why the
  adapter publishes the canonical event itself rather than waiting to observe one.
  The Frigate calls happen on the ingest node, next to the NVR — the cloud never
  needs access to it.
- 084d12a: Replace `/deployment_version` with `/status`, reporting every service instead of
  just the bot.
  
  The old command read the bot's own `package.json`, so it could only ever show
  one version. Services now announce themselves on `spotter.heartbeat` — name,
  version, node and uptime — on start and every 30 seconds; the bot keeps the
  latest report per service and renders them grouped by node.
  
  Carried on a stream rather than a Redis key, because keys do not cross the
  forwarder: a key-based report would leave the cloud bot blind to everything
  running on the ingest node.
  
  A service that dies stops reporting rather than announcing it, so reports older
  than three intervals are shown as offline instead of vanishing — an outage stays
  visible in the output.
  
  Services also report what they run on: the frigate adapter probes the NVR build
  via `/api/version`, depot reports its ffmpeg and the active acceleration, and
  server and telegram report the Redis server version. Probes resolve once and
  swallow their own failures — a broken probe must not cost the heartbeat.

### Patch Changes

- ec9422d: Answer media requests even when the NVR has nothing to give.
  
  `createMediaController` returned silently when staging produced no keys — the
  NVR 404s an event it no longer has, or never had. Nothing was published, so the
  bot's "Видео обрабатывается…" button stayed that way forever, with no timeout to
  clear it. It now publishes a `MediaProcessed` with no keys, and the bot restores
  the "Видео" button instead of leaving the message stuck.
  
  The empty answer is what `test_delivery` exposed — its synthetic ids exist in no
  NVR — but the same path is hit by real events whose recordings have aged out.
